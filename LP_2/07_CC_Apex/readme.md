**Salesforce**

Salesforce is a cloud-based software company known for its customer relationship management (CRM) product. It provides a suite of enterprise applications focused on customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development.

**Apex**

Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on Salesforce servers in conjunction with calls to the API. It enables the addition of custom business logic to system events, such as button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages.

**Features of Apex**

Integration: Apex can be used to call out to external APIs and receive data back to Salesforce.
Asynchronous Operations: Apex supports future methods, batch Apex, queueable Apex, and scheduled Apex, allowing for operations that run in the background.
Testing Framework: It has built-in support for unit test creation and execution, ensuring code coverage and testing before deployment.
Custom App in Salesforce
A custom app in Salesforce is a set of related custom and standard objects, tabs, and services designed to serve a specific business need. Users can customize the app by adding components necessary for a particular business process or set of users.

**Why Custom Apps Are Required**

Specific Business Needs: Custom apps allow businesses to tailor solutions that fit their unique processes which cannot be fulfilled by standard Salesforce apps.
User Experience: They help in streamlining operations for specific user roles by including only necessary features and data, enhancing user efficiency.
Integration: Custom apps can integrate with other systems and provide a unified interface for users, reducing complexity.
Scalability and Flexibility: Businesses can start with what they need and expand or modify the app as their requirements evolve.
Custom apps and the use of Apex in Salesforce are pivotal for businesses looking to leverage CRM for enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction, tailoring solutions to precise business requirements.
